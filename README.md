# AI_Image_Generator
Testing the potential of Keras resources.

## Run locally
If you have a good GPU you can download and launch by your prompt, make sure to install all the resource needed locally:
pip install keras-cv tensorflow --upgrade

## Use Colab
Otherwise you can try it on Colab, switch runtime to "T4 GPU" for a faster result.
Normally it takes 2-3 minutes to generate 3 images.
